# AI-Plays-Games

This repository features projects where Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms are trained to play and master various games. These projects showcase different AI techniques, including reinforcement learning and neuro-evolutionary algorithms, demonstrating how AI can learn optimal strategies through experience.

# AI Game Projects Included:

* **Flappy-Bird-NEAT-AI:** An implementation where the NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm is used to train AI agents to play the popular game Flappy Bird. This demonstrates how neural networks can evolve to solve complex control problems.

* **Snake-Game-qlearning:** An AI agent trained to play the classic Snake game using the Q-learning reinforcement learning algorithm. This project highlights how an AI can learn to make decisions based on rewards and penalties to achieve a high score.

Explore each project's subdirectory to understand the AI implementation, training process, and how the AI agents perform in the game environments.
